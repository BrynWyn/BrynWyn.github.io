The longer I spend working in the industry, the rustier my software toolkit becomes. As a software developer I need to make sure I have the correct tools, and the knowledge on how to use them.
So far in the industry I have only really worked with backend software development using C# / Java / C++. Time for a change.

<p>That brings me to my new years resolution. I have decided to dedicate at least one evening a week to work on my own project. And to help me keep track of what I am doing? This blog.<p>

<p>Firstly I am starting out with React and Gatsby (This blog). So keep an eye as the blog continues to evolve as the year moves on. </p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Gatsby seems to be extremely easy to setup. Highly recommended.</p>
